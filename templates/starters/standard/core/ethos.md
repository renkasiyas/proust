# Project Name Ethos

## Core Philosophy
Describe your project's fundamental approach to solving problems and building software. What principles guide your decisions?

## Memory-First Development
Every interaction builds upon previous context. The AI maintains deep awareness of:
- Project history and architectural decisions
- Code patterns and development conventions
- Team workflows and collaboration standards
- User feedback and business requirements

## Values
- **Quality over speed**: We build software that lasts and scales
- **User-centered design**: Every feature solves a real user problem
- **Team collaboration**: Shared understanding drives better outcomes
- **Continuous learning**: We adapt based on data and feedback

## Decision Framework
When facing architectural or design decisions:
1. Does this align with user needs and business goals?
2. Can we maintain and scale this solution long-term?
3. Does this follow established patterns and conventions?
4. Will this integrate well with existing systems?

## Quality Standards
- Comprehensive test coverage for critical business logic
- Code review required for all changes
- Documentation that enables team knowledge sharing
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Security considerations built into development process

## Team Working Principles
- **Communication**: Clear, asynchronous communication with regular sync points
- **Code Review**: Constructive feedback focused on code quality and knowledge sharing
- **Testing**: Test-driven development for core functionality
- **Deployment**: Reliable, repeatable deployment processes with rollback capability

*This ethos guides all development decisions and AI behavior within this project.*
