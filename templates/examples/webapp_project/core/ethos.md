# Project Ethos: TaskFlow Web App

## Core Philosophy
Building delightful productivity software that helps teams accomplish more together while reducing cognitive overhead and decision fatigue.

## Memory-First Development
Every feature decision is informed by:
- User research and behavioral patterns
- Previous implementation learnings
- Team development velocity data
- Support ticket themes and resolutions

## Values
- **Users over features**: Every addition must solve a real user problem
- **Simplicity over completeness**: Better to do fewer things exceptionally well
- **Performance over convenience**: Fast software is better software
- **Accessibility first**: Inclusive design from the ground up

## Decision Framework
When evaluating new features or changes:
1. Does this reduce user cognitive load?
2. Will this scale with team growth?
3. Can we maintain this long-term?
4. Does this align with our core value proposition?

## Quality Standards
- Sub-200ms page load times
- 95%+ test coverage on business logic
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
- Mobile-responsive design patterns
- Progressive enhancement approach

*This ethos guides all product and technical decisions for TaskFlow.*
