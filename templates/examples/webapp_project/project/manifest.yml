# Notes and Context
notes: |
  TaskFlow started as an internal tool and evolved into a product
  after seeing high adoption across engineering teams.

  Key architectural decisions:
  - Next.js for SSR and optimal performance
  - PostgreSQL for reliable data consistency
  - Socket.io for real-time features
  - Tailwind for rapid UI development

  Current focus: Real-time collaboration features that feel
  magical but remain performant at scale.
