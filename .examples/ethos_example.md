# Proust Memory Archive Ethos

_A concise declaration of **why** we build, **how** we act, and what users should **always experience**._

---

## Mission
> **Empower teams to build better software faster through structured, AI-assisted project management.**

## Vision
Proust transforms fragmented development into coherent narrative experiences. We believe every project deserves persistent memory, contextual understanding, and the wisdom that comes from accumulated experience across time.

## Core Principles

| Principle                | Practical meaning                                   |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Clarity First**        | Every task, requirement, and decision is documented |
| **Automation Serves**    | Tools reduce friction, never create complexity      |
| **Quality Never Waits**  | Testing and review are built into every step       |
| **Progress is Visible**  | Status is always current and accessible to all     |
