# Product Requirements Document: Backend Setup

## Overview

This document outlines the requirements for setting up the backend infrastructure for our application. The backend will provide API endpoints for client applications, handle data persistence, and implement business logic.

## Functional Requirements

### User Management

- FR-1.1: The system shall allow users to register with email and password
- FR-1.2: The system shall allow users to log in with their credentials
- FR-1.3: The system shall allow users to reset their password via email
- FR-1.4: The system shall allow users to update their profile information
- FR-1.5: The system shall allow administrators to disable user accounts

### Data Models

- FR-2.1: The system shall implement a User model with fields for:
  - Email (unique)
  - Password (hashed)
  - Profile information (name, avatar, etc.)
  - Role (user, admin)
  - Account status (active, disabled)

- FR-2.2: The system shall implement a Project model with fields for:
  - Title
  - Description
  - Creation date
  - Owner (User reference)
  - Members (User references)
  - Status (active, archived)

- FR-2.3: The system shall implement a Task model with fields for:
  - Title
  - Description
  - Due date
  - Assigned user (User reference)
  - Project (Project reference)
  - Status (todo, in_progress, done)
  - Priority (low, medium, high)

### API Endpoints

- FR-3.1: The system shall provide authentication endpoints:
  - POST /api/auth/register
  - POST /api/auth/login
  - POST /api/auth/reset-password
  - POST /api/auth/reset-password-confirm

- FR-3.2: The system shall provide user management endpoints:
  - GET /api/users/me
  - PUT /api/users/me
  - GET /api/users (admin only)
  - PUT /api/users/:id (admin only)

- FR-3.3: The system shall provide project management endpoints:
  - GET /api/projects
  - POST /api/projects
  - GET /api/projects/:id
  - PUT /api/projects/:id
  - DELETE /api/projects/:id

- FR-3.4: The system shall provide task management endpoints:
  - GET /api/projects/:id/tasks
  - POST /api/projects/:id/tasks
  - GET /api/tasks/:id
  - PUT /api/tasks/:id
  - DELETE /api/tasks/:id

## Non-Functional Requirements

- NFR-1: The backend shall be implemented using Node.js and Express
- NFR-2: The system shall use MongoDB for data persistence
- NFR-3: API response time shall be under 200ms for 95% of requests
- NFR-4: The system shall handle up to 1000 concurrent users
- NFR-5: The system shall implement JWT-based authentication
- NFR-6: All API endpoints shall be documented using OpenAPI/Swagger
- NFR-7: The codebase shall have at least 80% test coverage
- NFR-8: The system shall log all errors and API requests

## Constraints

- The backend must be deployable to AWS and Azure
- The system must comply with GDPR requirements for user data
- The API must be versioned to support future changes

## Assumptions

- The client applications will be responsible for input validation
- The backend will be accessed only through the API, not directly
- The database will be hosted on a managed service (MongoDB Atlas)

## Dependencies

- MongoDB Atlas account
- SMTP service for email sending
- JWT secret key management
