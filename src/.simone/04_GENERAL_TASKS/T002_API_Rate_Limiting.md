# Task: API Rate Limiting (EXAMPLE)

## Description
Implement rate limiting for the API to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage across all clients. This task involves adding middleware to track and limit requests based on client IP or API key.

**Note: This is an example general task to demonstrate how non-sprint-specific tasks might be structured in the Simone framework.**

## Goal / Objectives
- Protect API endpoints from abuse and excessive requests
- Implement configurable rate limits based on client authentication
- Track usage statistics for billing and monitoring
- Provide clear feedback to clients when limits are exceeded
- Ensure minimal performance impact on normal API operation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Rate limiting is applied to all public API endpoints
- [ ] Different rate limits are configurable based on client tier/authentication
- [ ] Response headers include rate limit information (limit, remaining, reset)
- [ ] When limit is exceeded, a 429 status code is returned with appropriate error message
- [ ] Rate limiting can be temporarily disabled for specific clients if needed
- [ ] Implementation has minimal impact on response times (<10ms overhead)
- [ ] Usage statistics are collected for monitoring and analysis

## Subtasks
- [x] Research rate limiting strategies and best practices
- [x] Evaluate libraries (express-rate-limit, rate-limiter-flexible, etc.)
- [x] Design rate limit tiers for different client types
- [ ] Implement rate limiting middleware
- [ ] Add custom response headers
- [ ] Create storage adapter for distributed rate limiting
- [ ] Implement override mechanism for special cases
- [ ] Add monitoring and alerts for rate limit events
- [ ] Document rate limiting behavior for API consumers
