# Task: Refactor Logging Module (EXAMPLE)

## Description
The current logging implementation is basic and needs to be enhanced to provide better visibility and monitoring capabilities. This task involves refactoring the logging module to add structured logging, log rotation, and improved error tracking.

**Note: This is an example general task to demonstrate how non-sprint-specific tasks might be structured in the Simone framework.**

## Goal / Objectives
- Implement structured JSON logging for better parsing by log analysis tools
- Add log rotation to prevent log files from growing too large
- Enable different log levels based on environment
- Add request ID tracking for tracing requests through the system
- Improve error logging with stack traces and contextual information

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Logs are output in structured JSON format
- [x] Log files are rotated based on size and/or date
- [x] Different log levels are used appropriately (debug, info, warn, error)
- [x] Each request has a unique ID that is logged with every related log entry
- [x] Error logs include stack traces and relevant request information
- [x] Performance impact of logging is minimal
- [x] Documentation is updated to reflect new logging capabilities

## Subtasks
- [x] Evaluate and select appropriate logging libraries and tools
- [x] Design the structured log format with required fields
- [x] Implement log rotation configuration
- [x] Add request ID middleware for request tracking
- [x] Enhance error logging with more contextual information
- [x] Update logging throughout the application to use new formats
- [x] Write tests for logging functionality
- [x] Document the new logging system
