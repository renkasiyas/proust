# ADR 001: Chosen Database System (EXAMPLE)

## Status

Accepted

## Date

2023-07-05

## Context

The backend system needs a database to store user accounts, projects, tasks, and other application data. The choice of database system will impact performance, scalability, development speed, and maintenance requirements.

**Note: This is an example Architecture Decision Record to demonstrate how ADRs might be structured in the Simone framework.**

We evaluated several options including:
- Relational databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
- Document databases (MongoDB, CouchDB)
- Key-value stores (Redis, DynamoDB)

## Decision

We will use **MongoDB** as the primary database for this project.

## Rationale

The decision was based on the following factors:

1. **Schema Flexibility**: The project requirements are expected to evolve rapidly during development. MongoDB's flexible schema allows us to iterate quickly without needing migrations for every model change.

2. **JSON-Native Data Model**: Our API communicates in JSON, and MongoDB's BSON format aligns well with our data structures. This reduces the object-relational impedance mismatch.

3. **Scalability**: MongoDB's horizontal scaling capabilities via sharding will support our growth projections.

4. **Developer Productivity**: The team has prior experience with MongoDB and Mongoose ODM, which will accelerate development.

5. **Performance**: For our read-heavy workloads with relatively simple query patterns, MongoDB offers good performance characteristics.

6. **Ecosystem**: The robust Node.js ecosystem around MongoDB with libraries like Mongoose provides tools for validation, middleware, and other features that align with our development approach.

Some concerns were raised about:
- Lack of ACID transactions across multiple documents (though MongoDB does support multi-document transactions now)
- Potential for data duplication in document model

We determined these concerns were manageable for our use case and outweighed by the benefits.

## Alternatives Considered

### PostgreSQL

Pros:
- Mature, proven technology with strong ACID compliance
- Excellent for complex relational data and joins
- Support for JSON data types provides some schema flexibility

Cons:
- Schema migrations could slow development velocity
- Object-relational mapping adds complexity
- Less natural fit for our document-oriented data model

### DynamoDB

Pros:
- Fully managed service with automatic scaling
- Predictable performance with guaranteed low-latency
- Strong consistency options

Cons:
- Less flexible query capabilities
- AWS lock-in
- Potentially higher cost for our access patterns
- Less familiar to the development team

## Consequences

### Positive

- Faster initial development due to schema flexibility
- Easier object mapping between API and database
- Good performance for our expected read-heavy workloads
- Simplified deployment with MongoDB Atlas

### Negative

- Will require care when modeling relationships between data
- May need supplementary systems (like Redis) for certain use cases
- Need to handle eventual consistency in some parts of the application

### Neutral

- Team will need to follow MongoDB best practices for schema design
- We'll use Mongoose ODM to provide schema validation and middleware

## Implementation Notes

- We will use MongoDB Atlas as the managed service for all environments
- Mongoose will be our ODM of choice
- Initial indexes will be created for user email, project names, and task status
- We will implement soft deletion for most entities
- Data validation will happen at both the Mongoose schema level and API input level
