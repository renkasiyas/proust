# Task: Setup Project Structure (EXAMPLE)

## Description
Set up the initial project structure for the backend API service, including directory organization, dependency installation, and basic configuration.

**Note: This is an example task to demonstrate the structure of a task in the Simone framework.**

## Goal / Objectives
- Create a well-organized, scalable project structure
- Set up the Express.js application with middleware
- Configure MongoDB connection
- Implement basic error handling
- Set up environment configuration
- Initialize logging system

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Project structure follows MVC pattern with clear separation of concerns
- [ ] Express application is set up with necessary middleware (CORS, body-parser, etc.)
- [ ] MongoDB connection is configured with error handling
- [ ] Environment variables are properly managed (development vs production)
- [ ] Logger is implemented for request/error tracking
- [ ] Basic error handling middleware is implemented
- [ ] Project runs without errors
- [ ] Initial tests pass

## Subtasks
- [ ] Initialize Node.js project with package.json
- [ ] Install core dependencies (express, mongoose, dotenv, etc.)
- [ ] Create directory structure for routes, controllers, models, middleware
- [ ] Set up Express application with basic middleware
- [ ] Configure MongoDB connection
- [ ] Implement environment-specific configurations
- [ ] Set up logging system
- [ ] Implement error handling middleware
- [ ] Write basic tests to verify configuration
