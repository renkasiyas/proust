# Sprint: Initial API Development (S01) (EXAMPLE)

## Sprint Goal
Implement the foundational API structure including user authentication, basic project endpoints, and the initial database models.

## Scope & Key Deliverables
1. Set up the project structure with Express.js and MongoDB
2. Implement user registration and authentication endpoints
3. Create basic project and task models
4. Implement core API endpoints for projects and tasks
5. Set up automated testing infrastructure

## Sprint Backlog
- [T01_S01_Setup_Project_Structure](./T01_S01_Setup_Project_Structure.md)
- [T02_S01_Define_User_Model](./T02_S01_Define_User_Model.md)
- [T03_S01_Implement_Auth_Endpoints](./T03_S01_Implement_Auth_Endpoints.md)
- [T04_S01_Define_Project_Model](./T04_S01_Define_Project_Model.md)
- [T05_S01_Implement_Project_Endpoints](./T05_S01_Implement_Project_Endpoints.md)

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
The sprint will be considered complete when:
- All sprint tasks are completed and meet their acceptance criteria
- All implemented endpoints pass their test cases
- API documentation is updated to reflect implemented endpoints
- Code has been reviewed and merged to the development branch

## Notes / Context
This is an example sprint document to demonstrate how sprints might be structured in a project using the Simone framework. This simulates what a typical initial API development sprint might look like.
