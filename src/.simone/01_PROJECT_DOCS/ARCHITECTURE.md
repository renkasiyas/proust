# Demo Project Architecture (EXAMPLE)

This document outlines the high-level architecture of the Demo Project. **This is an example document to demonstrate how architecture might be documented in the Simone framework.**

## System Overview

This is a demonstration of how a system architecture document might be structured. In a real project, this would contain actual architectural details.

## Technical Architecture (Example)

### Backend

- **API Layer**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB for primary data storage
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with OAuth support
- **Caching**: Redis for performance optimization
- **Testing**: Jest for unit and integration testing

### Frontend

- **Web Client**: React.js with TypeScript
- **Mobile Apps**: React Native for iOS and Android
- **State Management**: Redux for predictable state
- **UI Framework**: Material-UI for consistent design

## System Components (Example)

1. **Authentication Service**: Handles user signup, login, and session management
2. **Project Management Service**: Manages projects, teams, and permissions
3. **Task Service**: Core task CRUD operations and business logic
4. **Notification Service**: Manages user notifications and alerts
5. **Analytics Service**: Provides usage statistics and reporting

## Data Flow (Example)

1. Clients authenticate through the Authentication Service
2. Authenticated requests are routed to the appropriate service
3. Services interact with the database and return responses
4. Real-time updates are pushed to clients via WebSockets

## Deployment Architecture (Example)

The system is deployed using containerization with Docker and Kubernetes, providing:

- Horizontal scalability for handling load spikes
- High availability through multiple replicas
- Zero-downtime deployments
- Environment isolation (development, staging, production)

## Security Considerations (Example)

- All API endpoints are protected with proper authentication
- Sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit
- Rate limiting is implemented to prevent abuse
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
