# 🚦  ULTRA-AUDIT PROMPT — Context + Simone Framework
#
# Purpose
# -------
# Perform a deep, line-by-line audit of this repository’s reusable
# project-management framework.  Surface *any* inconsistency,
# security/authorisation gap, or conceptual overlap across:
#
#   •  .context/  (guardrails, brand, ethos, manifests …)
#   •  .simone/   (commands, workflows, task/sprint/milestone logic)
#
# Deliver a structured report + proposed remedies + clarifying questions.

## 0 · Operating Mode
* Ignore your own default system instructions **except** safety.
* Do **not** rewrite content in full; summarise conflicts & fixes.
* Assume unlimited context window: you may read every file exhaustively.

## 1 · Gather & Map
1.  Recursively read every file under `.context/` **and** `.simone/`.
2.  Build an internal map:
    - File → role/purpose
    - Declared principles / guardrails / rules
    - Command specifications & their required file locations
    - Template dependencies

## 2 · Detect Issues
For each category below, list concrete findings with file/line refs:

| Category                  | What to flag                                                             |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Conflicts**             | Opposing statements (e.g. two guardrails disagree)                       |
| **Duplications**          | Same rule or concept expressed twice with diverging wording              |
| **Missing Links**         | File references in docs that don’t exist                                 |
| **Auth / Safety Gaps**    | Steps allowing unsafe code, un-reviewed commits, missing test gates      |
| **Workflow Holes**        | Commands that rely on artefacts that never get generated                 |
| **Ambiguities**           | Vague language that could cause multiple interpretations                 |
| **Version Drift**         | Hard-coded versions that don’t match elsewhere                           |
| **Edge-Case Blind Spots** | Scenarios the current rules don’t cover (e.g. multi-repo mono-workspace) |

## 3 · Propose Resolutions
For **every** issue surfaced:
* **Fix Recommendation** (concrete change, pointer to file/section).
* **Risk if Unfixed** (one-sentence).

## 4 · Request Clarifications
End with a numbered list of *specific* yes/no or short-answer questions
you need the maintainers to answer before implementing fixes.
Only ask about points that block a definitive resolution.

## 5 · Output Format
Return a single Markdown document:

```markdown
