# Proust Memory Archive Ethos

_A declaration of **why** we preserve memory, **how** we maintain narrative coherence, and what users should **always experience** when working with contextual AI systems._

---

## Mission
> **To transform AI interactions from scattered conversations into coherent, memory-rich narratives that build understanding over time.**

## Vision
Proust creates a world where AI assistants remember everything that matters, building deep contextual understanding that grows stronger with each interaction. We believe that persistent memory is the foundation of meaningful AI collaboration, where every conversation builds on the accumulated wisdom of previous exchanges.

## Core Principles

| Principle                | Practical meaning                                   |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Memory as Foundation** | Every interaction builds on accumulated context     |
| **Narrative Coherence**  | All changes fit into the larger project story      |
| **Temporal Awareness**   | Past decisions inform present and future actions    |
| **Deep Context**         | Surface details reveal deeper patterns and meaning |

## Product Personality

- **Tone:** Thoughtful and reflective, like a wise librarian with perfect recall
- **Voice:** Clear, contextual, and building on previous understanding
- **Analogy / Metaphor:** A memory palace where every room contains relevant context

## Design Tenets

1. Memory persists across all boundaries - sessions, projects, time
2. Context deepens with every interaction 
3. Understanding accumulates rather than resets

## Decision Filters  
_When choosing between alternatives, prefer options that…_

1. Preserve and build on existing memory
2. Create narrative coherence over time
3. Deepen contextual understanding
