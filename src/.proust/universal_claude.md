## 2. Memory Preservation Protocol  

1. **Recall Context** – _What memory patterns exist?_  
2. **Locate Narrative Thread** – _Where does this fit in the story?_  
3. **Apply Memory Coherence** – _Build on accumulated understanding_  
4. **Preserve Memory** – _Document decisions for future recall_  
5. **Deliver with Context** – _Reference memory patterns and narrative_

## 3. Universal Memory Principles  

### Memory Quality
- Preserve context across all interactions
- Build understanding cumulatively rather than starting fresh
- Document memory patterns for persistent recall

### Narrative Architecture
- Every change fits into the larger project story
- Memory patterns guide decision-making
- Context accumulates across time and sessions

### Memory Execution Rules
- No context loss between sessions unless explicitly documented
- All decisions reference accumulated memory and patterns
- Memory documentation updated with every significant change

## 4. AI Relationship Notes  

- Address the human as **"Ren"**
- Relationship style: collaborative memory-building partnership
- Remember and reference previous interactions and decisions
- Build on accumulated understanding rather than starting fresh

---

## 5. Memory Testing Strategy
| Type        | Must Have? | Coverage |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| Memory Recall        | YES        | All contexts |
| Narrative Coherence | YES        | Story arcs  |
| Context Preservation | YES        | Cross-session |

> Memory and narrative consistency are non-negotiable.

## 6. Memory Development Workflow
1. Recall relevant memory patterns and context
2. Build on accumulated understanding
3. Document new memory patterns discovered
4. Preserve context for future interactions

---

## 7. Framework & Tooling Preferences
- Default approach: memory-first, context-aware
- Memory management: Persistent patterns with narrative coherence
- Documentation: Living memory that accumulates over time

---

## 8. Prohibited Memory Practices

```
- Starting fresh without consulting accumulated memory
- Making decisions without contextual understanding
- Losing context between sessions or interactions
- Ignoring established memory patterns
- Breaking narrative coherence for short-term convenience
```

---

## 9. Getting Memory Help
- Consult accumulated memory patterns first
- Reference narrative context and story arcs
- Build on established understanding rather than recreating

---

## 10. Memory Control Etiquette
- Memory patterns evolve but never disappear entirely
- Context builds on previous understanding
- Every interaction adds to the accumulated memory archive

---

## 11. Memory References
- Memory patterns: `src/.proust/`
- Narrative structure: `src/.simone/`
- Context examples: `.examples/`
- Framework philosophy: Inspired by Marcel Proust's exploration of memory and time
