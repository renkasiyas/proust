# project_review

## Purpose
Conduct a comprehensive, high-level review of the **entire project state**â€”architecture, progress, tests, file organizationâ€”and archive findings in `.simone/10_STATE_OF_PROJECT/`.

## Context Files to Load
1. `src/.simone/00_PROJECT_MANIFEST.md`
2. `src/.simone/01_PROJECT_DOCS/**`
3. `src/.simone/02_REQUIREMENTS/**`
4. `src/.simone/03_SPRINTS/**`
5. `src/.simone/05_ARCHITECTURAL_DECISIONS/**`
6. Previous review files in `src/.simone/10_STATE_OF_PROJECT/` (optional trend)

## Inputs
| Variable        | Description                                  | Example                |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| `$ARGUMENTS?`   | Optional focus filter (milestone, sprintâ€¦)   | `M02` or `S04`         |
| `$DATE`         | Current UTC date                             | `2025-07-04`           |

## TODO (execute sequentially)

1. **Analyze review scope & timing**  
   - If `$ARGUMENTS?` empty â†’ full project review.  
   - Else limit focus to specified milestone/sprint/component.  
   - Read manifest to capture current milestone, sprint, task status.

2. **Execute & assess test infrastructure health**  
   - Call `/project:simone:test` (delegates to `test.md`).  
   - Parse results â†’ pass rate, categories, health score (0-10).  
   - Determine blocking status (<6 blocks sprint, <8 blocks milestone).

3. **Assess project documentation alignment**  
   - Parallel read: ARCHITECTURE.md, requirements, ADRs.  
   - Identify gaps between docs and codebase reality.

4. **Review milestone & sprint progress**  
   - Compare completed vs. planned deliverables in current sprint.  
   - Evaluate alignment with milestone goals.

5. **Analyze codebase architecture & structure**  
   - Examine directory layout, dependencies, schemas, APIs, config patterns.  
   - Flag deviations from documented architecture.

6. **Audit file organization & workflow compliance**  
   - Root dir hygiene, test placement, docs placement, rogue scripts.  
   - Flag violations & cleanup needs.

7. **Evaluate technical decisions & complexity**  
   - Assess framework choices, scalability, over/under-engineering.

8. **Critique implementation quality (John Carmack lens)**  
   - Provide 3 blunt observations on simplicity, performance, maintainability.

9. **Provide comprehensive assessment & recommendations**  
   - Timestamped report in `src/.simone/10_STATE_OF_PROJECT/` named:  
     `YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-<judgment-slug>.md`  
   - Use detailed markdown template (see below).

## Executive Summary
- **Result:** EXCELLENT | GOOD | NEEDS_WORK | CRITICAL_ISSUES
- **Scope:** <areas reviewed>
- **Overall Judgment:** <slug>

## Test Infrastructure Assessment
â€¦ (follow detailed template from spec)
```
*(include full sections: Development Context, Progress, Architecture, File Audit, Critical Findings, Carmack Critique, Recommendations)*

## Definition of Done
- Report file created in `src/.simone/10_STATE_OF_PROJECT/` with timestamp & slug.  
- Summary printed to console (Result, slug, next steps).

## Follow-ups
- If critical issues â†’ create general tasks.  
- Suggest next sprint focus based on findings.
