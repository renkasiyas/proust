# testing_review

## Purpose
Assess the test suite’s alignment with the defined testing strategy (or general best practices), highlight misaligned tests, identify coverage gaps, and produce an actionable alignment report.

## Context Files to Load
1. `.simone/01_PROJECT_DOCS/TESTING_STRATEGY.md` (if exists)
2. `.simone/00_PROJECT_MANIFEST.md`
3. Test directories (`tests/`, `spec/`, etc.)

## Inputs
| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| *(none)* | Interactive command |

## Steps
1. **Prerequisite check**  
   - Detect `.simone/01_PROJECT_DOCS/TESTING_STRATEGY.md`.  
   - If not present → ask user: create strategy or proceed with generic review?  
   - Record approach (strategy vs. best-practice criteria).

2. **Analyze test implementation structure**  
   - Call `/project:simone:test` to run suite.  
   - Explore test directory layout, naming conventions, utilities.  
   - Identify categories (unit, integration, API).

3. **Evaluate test-to-code alignment**  
   - For each major component, assess if tests validate behavior.  
   - Flag tests focused on implementation details or with fragile setups.

4. **Identify misaligned / unnecessary tests**  
   - Using strategy document (if exists) or general principles:  
     - Over-engineered, out-of-scope, redundant tests.  
   - Compile list for removal or simplification.

5. **Assess critical functionality coverage**  
   - Verify high-priority areas (from strategy or critical paths) have adequate tests.  
   - Note missing tests for auth, error handling, data integrity, integrations.

6. **Generate modification recommendations**  
   - For each finding:  
     ```
     File: <path>::<test_name>
     Issue: <problem>
     Action: <remove/simplify/add>
     Reason: <alignment rationale>
     ```

7. **Create alignment report**  
   - Timestamped file: `.simone/10_STATE_OF_PROJECT/YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-test-alignment.md`  
   - Use detailed markdown template (Alignment Summary, Tests Requiring Modification, Recommended Actions, Test Health Indicators, Next Review).  
   - Print concise console summary.

## Definition of Done
- Report file created with alignment rating and actionable list.  
- Console summary printed.  
- Any questions asked to user resolved.

## Follow-ups
- Convert recommended actions into tasks via `/create_general_task`.  
- If no strategy exists, propose creating `TESTING_STRATEGY.md`.
