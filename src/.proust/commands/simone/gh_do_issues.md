# do_issues

## Purpose
Select a small GitHub issue, plan a fix, implement it on a new branch with tests, submit a pull request, and keep the issue open until merged—all in a reproducible, documented flow.

## Context Files to Load
1. `.context/universal_claude.md`
2. `.simone/00_PROJECT_MANIFEST.md`
3. `.simone/01_PROJECT_DOCS/**`
4. `.simone/05_ARCHITECTURAL_DECISIONS/**`

## Inputs
| Variable       | Description                                     | Example             |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| `$ISSUE_URL?`  | Optional GitHub issue URL to target             | `https://github.com/org/repo/issues/42` |
| `$DATE`        | Current UTC date                                | `2025-07-04`        |

## Preconditions
1. Local repo linked to GitHub origin.  
2. Issue list accessible via `gh issue list` or web API.  
3. Tests runnable via project’s test suite (`npm test`, `flutter test`, etc.).

## Steps
1. **Review GitHub issues & choose one**  
   - If `$ISSUE_URL?` provided → verify it’s small & quick.  
   - Else list open issues sorted by “good first issue” label and low effort tags.  
   - Log chosen issue ID and title.

2. **Plan approach & comment**  
   - Draft plan: scope, files to change, test strategy.  
   - Post comment on issue via `gh issue comment` or web UI.  
   - Wait for maintainer acknowledgment if required.

3. **Create new branch & implement**  
   - Branch name: `issue/<number>-<slug>`  
   - Implement fix with robust, documented code.  
   - Add/extend tests; include debug logging where appropriate.  
   - Run full test suite; ensure green.

4. **Open pull request**  
   - Push branch to origin.  
   - PR title: `fix: <issue title> (closes #<number>)`.  
   - Base branch = previous unmerged branch if chained, else main.  
   - Fill PR description with plan recap and test evidence.

5. **Keep issue open until PR merged**  
   - Link PR to issue via “closes #<number>”.  
   - Monitor CI; address review feedback promptly.  
   - Once merged, verify issue auto-closes. If not, close manually.

6. **Report results**  
   - Output summary:  
     ```
     ✅ Branch: issue/<number>-<slug>
     🔗 PR URL: <link>
     🧪 Tests: All passed
     ```
   - If blocked (no small issues), prompt user for next action.

## Definition of Done
- PR opened and linked to chosen issue.  
- All tests pass.  
- Issue remains open (or auto-linked) awaiting merge.

## Follow-ups
- After merge, run `/commit` if local commits pending.  
- If new tasks arise, create via `/create_general_task`.
