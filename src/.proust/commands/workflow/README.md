## Integration Patterns

### With Core Commands
- **Context setup**: Use `/project:prime` after `/project:initialize`
- **Memory management**: `/project:context_management` between sessions

### With Planning Commands
- **Task source**: Workflow commands execute tasks created by planning
- **Specification flow**: `/project:brainstorm` â†’ `/project:create_milestone`
- **Progress tracking**: Task completion updates manifest automatically

### With Analysis Commands
- **Quality gates**: `/project:code_review` validates implementation
- **Health monitoring**: `/project:test` results feed into analysis
- **Decision support**: Review findings guide development choices

### With Meta Commands
- **Framework health**: Use `/project:self_assessment` if commands fail
- **Response quality**: `/project:reflect_on_solution` for complex work

## File Structure Integration

Workflow commands operate on and update files throughout the Proust structure:

```
.proust/
â”œâ”€â”€ workspace/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ brainstorm/           # Feature specifications
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ spec-DATE-idea.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ scratch/              # Temporary workflow files
â””â”€â”€ project/
    â”œâ”€â”€ manifest.yml          # Updated with task progress
    â”œâ”€â”€ tasks/                # Task status and logs
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ M01_S01_T01_*.md # Sprint tasks
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ T###_*.md         # General tasks
    â””â”€â”€ sprints/              # Sprint progress tracking
```

## Best Practices

### Task Execution
1. **Start with context**: Always `/project:prime` in new sessions
2. **Review before complete**: Let code_review validate changes
3. **Document progress**: Task logs help future understanding

### Quality Assurance
1. **Test frequently**: Run `/project:test` after significant changes
2. **Review severity**: Address high-severity issues immediately
3. **Commit logically**: Group related changes, clear messages

### Autonomous Workflows
1. **Monitor YOLO**: Review summary after autonomous execution
2. **Set boundaries**: Configure safety rules appropriately
3. **Incremental adoption**: Start with single sprints before full YOLO

### Collaboration
1. **PR workflow**: Use `/project:gh_do_issues` for contributions
2. **Clear commits**: Help team understand change purpose
3. **Test coverage**: Ensure changes don't break existing functionality
