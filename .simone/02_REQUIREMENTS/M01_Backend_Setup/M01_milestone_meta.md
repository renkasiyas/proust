# Milestone: Backend Setup (EXAMPLE)

## Goals
This milestone focuses on establishing the core backend infrastructure for the project, including:

1. Setting up the initial project structure
2. Defining the database schema and models
3. Implementing basic API endpoints
4. Establishing authentication and authorization systems

## Key Documents
- [Product Requirements Document](./PRD_Backend_Setup.md)
- [API Specifications V1](./SPECS_API_V1.md)
- [Auth Flow Update Amendment](./PRD_AMEND_01_Auth_Flow_Update.md)

## Definition of Done (DoD)
This milestone will be considered complete when:

- The backend server can be started and responds to API requests
- All core models are defined and can be created/updated/deleted via the API
- Authentication is working with JWT tokens
- Basic error handling is implemented
- Integration tests are passing for all endpoints

## Notes / Context
This is an example milestone document to demonstrate how milestones might be structured in a project using the Simone framework. The backend infrastructure established here would be the foundation for a typical web application.
